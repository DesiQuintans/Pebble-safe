## Preview

Pebble-Safe is a colourblind-friendly theme for RStudio 1.2.x. It comes in Light and Dark variants, but I recommend the Dark variant because it makes better use of the few safe colours that are available. The font used in the screenshots below is Hack in 10 pt <https://sourcefoundry.org/hack>.

## Installation

You need to be running RStudio v 1.2.x. At the time of writing (2019-03-03) this is only available as a Preview, so you need to download and install the newest Preview here <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/>.


First, install the `rstudioapi` package.

``` r
install.packages("rstudioapi")

```

Then, run the commands below to install the theme.

``` r
# Light variant:
rstudioapi::addTheme("https://github.com/DesiQuintans/Pebble-safe/releases/download/1.0.0/Pebble-Safe_Light.rstheme",
apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)

# Dark variant
rstudioapi::addTheme("https://github.com/DesiQuintans/Pebble-safe/releases/download/1.0.0/Pebble-Safe_Dark.rstheme",
apply = TRUE, force = TRUE)

```

You can change the active theme at any time by going to (Tools → Global Options → Appearance) and applying a new theme. 

The themes can be uninstalled by selecting them in the list and clicking (Remove).



## Colourblind-friendly palettes

Choosing colours for syntax highlighting has a few extra difficulties compared to designing a poster or chart:

1. Text at normal sizes has thinner outlines that make subtle colours harder to differentiate.
2. Syntax highlighting is supposed to convey more information to the reader, and it's hard to convey lots of information with a smaller palette of styles and still have each type of information clearly distinct from the others.
3. The background of the text can affect the clarity of the colours. Yellow is one of the few safe colours out there, and yellow text on a white background is basically unreadable.

I found a few reliable sources for colourblind-friendly colour palettes.

This table of 8 colours is from Wong (2011).

   > Wong, Bang. “Points of View: Color Blindness.” Nature Methods 8 (May 27, 2011): 441.  
   > https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1618.

This table of qualitative colors is from the `RColorBrewer` package.

   > Erich Neuwirth (2014). RColorBrewer: ColorBrewer Palettes. R package version 1.1-2.  
   > https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RColorBrewer

```{r}
display.brewer.all(type = "qual", colorblindFriendly = TRUE)
```

And this table of colours is from Sasha Trubetskoy.

   > https://sashat.me/2017/01/11/list-of-20-simple-distinct-colors, accessed 2019-02-27.

```{r}
sasha_cols <- c("#FFE119", "#4363D8", "#F58231", "#FABEBE", "#E6BEFF", 
                "#800000", "#000075", "#A9A9A9", "#FFFFFF", "#000000")

show_colours(sasha_cols)
```



## Testing the colours

Here are all of the colours in one swatch. I've also added `#FCFCFC`, my preferred light background colour, just a whisker off pure white so it's a little easier on the eyes.

```{r}
raw_cols <- c("#666666", "#A6761D", "#E6AB02", "#66A61E", "#E7298A", "#7570B3", 
              "#D95F02", "#1B9E77", "#A6CEE3", "#1F78B4", "#B2DF8A", "#33A02C", 
              "#FB9A99", "#E31A1C", "#FDBF6F", "#FF7F00", "#CAB2D6", "#6A3D9A", 
              "#FFFF99", "#B15928", "#B3B3B3", "#E5C494", "#FFD92F", "#A6D854", 
              "#E78AC3", "#8DA0CB", "#FC8D62", "#66C2A5", "#CD7EAA", "#D5683A", 
              "#2A78B5", "#F1E54E", "#2AA179", "#62B6E6", "#E7A337", "#292929",
              "#FFE119", "#4363D8", "#F58231", "#FABEBE", "#E6BEFF", "#800000", 
              "#000075", "#FCFCFC", "#A9A9A9")

show_colours(raw_cols)
```

### Try to programmatically remove similar colours under red-green blindness

This is what the colour tiles above look like when deuteranopia (the most common kind of colourblindness) is simulated with Color Oracle <https://colororacle.org/>.

```{r}
deut_cols <- c("#666666", "#868614", "#BEBE00", "#969626", "#888886", "#7171B2", 
               "#909000", "#888879", "#C3C3E3", "#6767B5", "#D2D28B", "#8A8A34", 
               "#BDBD95", "#838300", "#D3D36C", "#B0B000", "#B9B9D5", "#4E4E99", 
               "#FEFE99", "#7B7B21", "#B2B2B2", "#CECE93", "#E4E42A", "#CACA57", 
               "#ABABC0", "#9A9ACB", "#B6B65D", "#ADADA6", "#9A9AA8", "#939331", 
               "#6868B5", "#E8E84E", "#8A8A7B", "#A2A2E6", "#B9B931", "#2A2A2A", 
               "#E9E914", "#5B5BD8", "#ADAD21", "#D1D1BC", "#CACAFE", "#4A4A00", 
               "#141475", "#FBFBFB", "#A8A8A8")

show_colours(deut_cols)
```

I can take these deuteranopia colours, convert them to RGB space, round their RGB scores to a common scale (e.g. round them to the nearest 10), and programmatically eliminate colours that are at the same RGB point.

```{r}
round_rgb <- function(hexcol, to = 1, dir = NULL) {
    col2rgb(hexcol) %>% 
        round_to_nearest(to = to, dir = dir) %>% 
        paste(collapse = " ")
}

cols <- 
    tibble(hex_col = raw_cols,
           hex_deut = deut_cols) %>% 
    rowwise() %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(starts_with("hex_")), 
              list(round = ~ round_rgb(., 10))) %>% 
    distinct(hex_deut_round, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
    distinct(hex_col_round, .keep_all = TRUE)

show_colours(cols$hex_col)
```

We eliminated these 3 colours :

```{r}
show_colours(c("#2A78B5", "#2AA179", "#A9A9A9"), main = "Excluded colours")

```


### Manually select colours under red-green blindness

```{r}
show_colours(cols$hex_deut)
```

I hand-picked all of the colours that I could easily differentiate, trying to maximise the differences between them. I made sure they were easy to differentiate them by dragging them beside each other in my colour picker (JCPicker <http://annystudio.com/software/colorpicker>) and squinting at their differences.

```{r echo=FALSE}
my_deut <- c("#E9E914", "#FEFE99", "#CACAFE", "#5B5BD8", "#2A2A2A", 
             "#888886", "#FBFBFB")

show_colours(sort(my_deut))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
filter(cols, hex_deut %in% my_deut) %>% 
    arrange(hex_deut) %>% 
    use_series(hex_col) %>% 
    show_colours()
```


### Selected theme colours

So I guess these are my theme colours! These colours are okay under simulated deuteranopia, protanopia, and  tritanopia.

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat("Normal vision colours:\n")
filter(cols, hex_deut %in% my_deut) %>% 
    arrange(hex_deut) %>% 
    use_series(hex_col)

cat("\nDeuteranopic version:\n")
print(my_deut)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
show_colours(sort(my_deut))

filter(cols, hex_deut %in% my_deut) %>% 
    arrange(hex_deut) %>% 
    use_series(hex_col) %>% 
    show_colours()
```


## Designing the themes

(These are notes for the author and for any other theme authors who want to know the process. If you are a user, you only need to follow the [Installation instructions](#installation) above.)

It is often easier to visualise design changes by editing the stylesheet live in the inspector. Right-click on the RStudio editor pane and choose _Inspect Element_. In the left nav pane of the inspector, choose _theme/custom/local → your .rsTheme file_. You can edit the settings here but you cannot save the changes in the inspector.

### 1. Use a GUI editor to make a `.tmTheme`

I use <https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com>. The RStudio theme backend has only some limited scopes, and the colourblind-friendly palette is so limited that I can't use all of them anyway.

These are the resources for designing a theme:

- <https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes>
- <https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html>



#### Scope names that are actually used in RStudio

I compiled this list by editing the **3024 Day** theme in [TmTheme Editor](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com), changing all of the colours to a unique colour in a series (#DDDD01, #DDDD02, ...). I downloaded the `.tmTheme`, converted it to `.rsTheme` with `rstudioapi::convertTheme()`, and then retrieved all of the colour codes that were still present in the converted document.

Once that was done I extracted all of the scope names for the preserved colours, put them into a new theme, and assigned each name a unique colour from `desiderata::palette_distinct(spaced = FALSE)`. I downloaded the theme, converted it, and then viewed one of my Rmarkdown files in high zoom while using a colour picker tool to find out which of the unique colours were actually used by RStudio.

### 2. Convert it to a `.rsTheme` in RStudio

```{r eval=FALSE}
rstudioapi::convertTheme("src/Pebble-safe Light.tmTheme")
rstudioapi::convertTheme("src/Pebble-safe Dark.tmTheme")
```


### 3. Edit the theme CSS by hand

Not much functionality is exposed via the editor theme scopes. These features need to be added by hand.

These edits are made inside the converted `.rstheme` files. For me, these files are located in `Documents\.R\rstudio\themes`.  I edit them in place and copy them to this repo to distribute them.

#### Fix heading style

Only the text colour of the markdown headings can be safely changed. Changing the background colour masks the selection box, and changing the text size makes the cursor no longer line-up with the text on that header line.



``` css
.ace_markup.ace_heading {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #REPLACEME;
}

.ace_heading {
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #REPLACEME;

}
```

#### Matching bracket indicator

Make it magenta to match the cursor.

``` css
.ace_bracket {
  margin: 0 !important;
  border: 0 !important;
  background-color: #CURSORCOLOUR;
}
```

#### Markdown block background

I made the background of the markdown blocks more similar to the normal background, and I added borders on the left and right sides of the block to delineate it.

I ideally would have liked to have a line at the top and bottom of the block, but the style is applied on a per-line basis and the block itself is not a single box element.

```
.ace_marker-layer .ace_foreign_line {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  background-color: #fdfdfd; for light
  background-color: #2d2d2d; for dark
  border-right: 2px solid #cccccc;
  margin-right: 5px;
}
```

#### Column margin line

The default is too bright in the Dark variant.

```
.ace_print-margin {
  width: 1px;
  background: #424242;
}
```
